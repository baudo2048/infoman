If you ever installed a development environment, you know how many time you need
to spend before starting programming itself.

Things go worst when you learn on your own skin than even after you was able to
install anything you may note that you've forgotten how to repeat the
installation one more time. You forget it.

So I decided to schedule a new article every day because so I have the
opportunity to focus on a particular topic. Stay focused!
