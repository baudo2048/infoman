**Web Content Graphics**
It is customary to include the content of this page under the category of Web
Design. I think it is not exactly correct to continue using the `design` term
because it is misleading. `Content count!`

**Tools**
- Paint 3d - Rapid create 3d wordArt

**How to deploy 3d wordArt from Paint 3d to Atom+jekyll-post**
If you are writing a blog post and you want include a 3d text slogan, you can
leverage the simple Windows Paint 3d. Suppose you are writing a blog post
and need rapid text formatting. First of all I'd start from Atom itself,
you need a real slogan, a phrase, an idea of it, you need to write down
your phrase directly in your Atom editor while you are writing your blog
post, hence we need a macro that transfer a selected text from Atom to a new
Paint 3d page opened in front of you. Dopodoch√® si vorrebbe salvare in modo
asincrono la modifica effettuata all'immagine.

**CSS - Cascading Style Sheet**
Utilizzare direttamente il css 3 al limite chi non lo supporto vede un testo
semplice e buono.

{% highlight css %}
// Create a wordArt slogan
.wordArt {

}
{% endhighlight %}
