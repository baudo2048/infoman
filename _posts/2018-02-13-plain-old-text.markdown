What if all knowledge would be only plain old text? The reason is very simple
the problem is to go directly to the main goals. So here I am!

What I need is only two hour a day of writing activity, maybe I may return
to old abitudini e magari chiss√†...

The answer is: is almost impossible if you work eight hours a day.

So, how to improve our knowledge of world and increase our positions in
society. What are limiting your life to achieve your goals?

Time is the king...
